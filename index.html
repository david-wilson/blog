<p>My name is David Wilson, and I am a professional software developer and student in Georgia Tech's <a href="https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/">OMSCS</a> program (graduating Fall 2016). At my job, I work on backend web systems using Java, Spring, and PostgreSQL. I also like to work with other technologies, which I try to write about here when I can. You can e-mail me at my first name at this domain.</>
